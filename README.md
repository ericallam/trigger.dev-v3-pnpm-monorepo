# trigger.dev v3 pnpm monorepo (app variant)

Things to note:

- The trigger.dev code lives in the apps/web directory, a next.js app
- The `apps/web` has a workspace dependency at `@repo/dsl`, but it does not use tsconfig.compilerOptions paths to do direct imports, instead `@repo/dsl` defines exports in it's package.json
- In the `trigger.config.ts` file, we specify that we want to bundle any imports that match `/@repo\/dsl/`
